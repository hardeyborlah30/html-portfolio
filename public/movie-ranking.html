<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Summer i turned pretty</h3>
<p> Although i havent completed the series, it is a rom-com with an high school plot<br /> Very interesting tho.</p>
<h3>The good doctor</h3>
<p>This movie is also in series, but it is really cool and very emotional.</p>
<h3>Tale of the nine tailed 1983</h3>
<p>This movie is based on deception, misunderstandings and brotherly love. <br />Although it is a k-drama, it is interesting nonetheless.</p>
