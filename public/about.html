<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hola Familia. i am Ameenah mostly called Adebola. A young teenager trying to find her place in this whole big gigantic world.
  i started learning coding well, i did say for quite a while now but somehow i havent quite been serious about it. Mostly been stopping midway prolly cause of lost of interest or i dont know. 
</p>

<p> Well right from my childhood days have always dreamt  of becoming a surgeon, a neurosurgeon at that. Dr Benjamin Carson was my role model then and even now that i lost interest in the medical
  field. I never thought there would be a time i did have to choose tech over medicine. I had thought it was my calling until i found out even though i have a passion for it. i do not have what it takes
  to be a medical student. well till now, i think it was my laziness then. Because mostly everyone thought if i had actually given medicine a chance i did have excel but i thought otherwise. 

</p>

<p>As much as i loved the idea of wearinga white coat, attending to the sick, being busy it just didnt felt like it was my cvalling. And i'd regret that i wasted some useful years of my life studying something
  that didnt work out for me at the end. So therefore i concluded on pursuing my hobby then. well what was my hobby? My hobby when growing up was always typing and typing. i always fall in love with fingers always dancing
on a keyboard.</p>
<p>so while growing up i researched more on what could be done on a system. And that where i figured out "hey girl, it is gonna be tech or tech". while growing up and when i started to understand that there are los
of specialization in it, i figured out i wanted to go into programming because to me, i see it as a shadowy job. A job you do behind scene which i really love. Anyways, to cut the long story short, Am looking forward to learning more
computer languages. once am done with html, i did like to try out python.</p> 
<p>Thank you soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmuuuuuuuuch for taking your time to read and check up my code. I sincerely appreciate.</p>
